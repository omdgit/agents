       "- It can **generate, test, and refine feature sets**, exploring combinations or transformations (e.g., temporal features, behavioral aggregates) more rapidly than manual feature engineering.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Adaptive Model Training & Selection**\n",
       "- Rather than static models, agentic AI can **continuously train and evaluate multiple candidate models** in the background, identifying best-performing algorithms and feature sets over time.\n",
       "- It can **auto-tune hyperparameters** and adjust thresholds optimized around organizational needs, for example, balancing precision/recall depending on current risk appetite or regulatory changes.\n",

       "### 3. **Intelligent Alert Triage and Prioritization**\n",
       "- Agentic AI can **score alerts dynamically**, incorporating uncertainty estimates and confidence intervals.\n",
       "- It can **assign priorities to alerts for analysts based on risk scores and historical analyst decisions**, focusing human effort where the model’s uncertainty is higher or the risk is elevated.\n",
       "- Implement **automated filtering agents** that suppress or group low-risk false positives, reducing alert fatigue.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Explainability and Compliance Integration**\n",
       "- Agentic systems can **generate on-demand explanations for each flagged alert**, extracting SHAP/LIME or natural language explanations that analysts or auditors can consume.\n",
       "- By monitoring regulatory updates automatically, agentic AI can **adjust interpretability parameters** ensuring models meet compliance requirements without manual rework.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Analyst Feedback and Active Learning Loop**\n",
       "- Automated agents can **interact with AML analysts, gathering feedback on alerts and investigations**—essentially an active learning framework where the model is continuously fine-tuned based on new labels.\n",
       "- This feedback loop can be used by the agent to **identify weaknesses or biases in the model**, prompting retraining or rebalancing of classes.\n",

       "\n",
       "#### 1. **Automate Data Collection and Signal Generation**\n",
       "- Use an AI agent to continuously stream market data from Alpaca’s API.\n",
       "- Implement technical indicators David Green teaches (e.g., moving averages, breakouts, volume spikes).\n",
       "- The AI agent can evaluate these indicators against his rule set in real time to identify trade signals.\n",

       "\n",
       "#### 4. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**\n",
       "- While David Green’s strategy is mostly rule-based, agentic AI can log trade outcomes and learn to tweak parameters slightly to adapt to changing market volatility or conditions.\n",
       "- You can implement a simpler machine learning regression or classification model that acts as a secondary filter on trade signals.\n",

       "- The agentic AI can notify you with explanations of trade signals and rationale.\n",
       "- You can approve or veto specific trades to maintain control while learning.\n",
       "\n",
